<H1>All About Me</H1>
<DIV>
	<P>My name is John Herman, and I am from Atlanta, Georgia. I have two siblings, a younger brother and sister, and we are all four years apart from one another. Growing up, I went to a Catholic High school called Marist School, at which I played basketball and lacrosse. Sports have always been what I value most in life, and the friendships and character that I have built through them define who I am today.</P>
	<I>Here is a picture of Marist Campus</I>:

	<B>Activities that I participated in at Marist:</B>
	<UL>
		<LI>Varsity Basketball</LI>
		<LI>Varsity Lacrosse</LI>
		<LI>National Honor Society</LI>
		<LI>Spanish Club</LI>
	</UL>
	<P>In the classroom, I always favored math courses over English, history, or anything else for that matter. Another big interest to me academically was computer science. Taking AP computer science was a big challenge for me just because I was fairly new with computers, but what I have learned from that class will greatly influence what I do with technology in the future. Statistics has also been of great interest to me, and taking the AP course in high school helps me cope with the business courses in college.</P>
	<U>Here is the list of AP courses I took and the scores I received on the exams:</U>

	<P>Attending the University of Georgia has been one of the best decisions of my entire life. This campus has a place for everyone, and whether you are in a fraternity or on scholarship for football, you can find your place with the best friends you will ever make. Trying out for the club lacrosse team here at UGA has been a great choice for me; I have made such great friends and coming together to play the sport that we all love is very special.</P>
